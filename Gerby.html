<h3>Company Description:</h3>
<li>Our company is Gerby's Slime, it was established on January 31st, 2023. The CEO, Gerby was a little bit bored one day. So she looked up "What to do when your bored", on google. She then stumbled across a list...1) Read a book. "Interesting, but not my mood right now", she thought. 2) Bake a new recipe. "I enjoy baking,"" she thought, "but I'm not very hungry right now." Then 3) Make some slime, "this is the one", she thought. She looked up a youtube tutorial on how to create slime, and she had just discovered her new passion.  </li>
<li>We produce only the highest quality of slime. We use minimal chemicals, and wholesome ingredients. including Elmer's glue, biodegradable glitter, biodegradable jars, and only cruelty-free scents.</li>

<li>It is faily easy to get into this industry. Anyone could really do it if they wanted to. But only few can succeed. With trial and tribulations, Gerby was able to succeed and master the craft. </li>
<li>My competition includes Nickelodeon slime, Play-doh, Aaron's Thinking Putty, Kawaii Slime Company, and Dope Slimes, our company is better than all of those because. 1) We advocate for sustainability. 2) We believe in fair pricing. 3) Our slime is creative, fun and has the best scents.</li>
<li>Our prices are best for our consumers, because we are able to buy high quality materials, and pay our employees good. While also keeping it affordable, starting at only $4.99 for a slime.</li>

<div class = "business">
<p>
	Our business falls under the "Monopolistic Competition" market structure, because there are many slime shops that exist, and they all sell the same basic product. Slime!

	But there are 3 other main types of market structures. Such as:
</p>


	<figcaption>Free Market: example would be a farmer's market, because there are a large number of buyers and sellers where market share does not influence price.</figcaption>
	<img src="https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/photovegetablemarket.jpg" class = "freeMarket">



	<figcaption>Monopoly: Standard Oil is a monopoly because it's a market strcuture with only one seller.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Oligopoly: Google is an oligopoly because it's a market structure where there are a few firms participating within the market. It's a giant business with a lot of consumers.</figcaption>
